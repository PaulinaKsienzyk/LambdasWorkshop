= Simple Lambdas Workshop

During the workshop, we will focus on the advantages of lambdas. What do we need them for?

Agenda.

. Why old-fashioned external iteration is error prone?
.. Check and correct bugs,
.. replace loop with streams,
.. refactor to anonymous class,
.. refactor to lambda expression.
. When lambda calls a method... Method references - less code, more readable code!
. Compose functional interfaces - inspiration from one of the side quests;-) (Pawel K, who was not at the pre-academy - those were extra tasks.
. Bonus! Can lambda expression be used to define recursive functions? Let's check it!

Enjoy!
